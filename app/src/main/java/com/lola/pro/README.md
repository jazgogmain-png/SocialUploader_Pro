🏎️ @DriftingGrandma - SocialUploader
"Pansit Speed" Edition: A Gemini 3 Flash-Powered Content Refinery
Welcome to the internal engine of the @DriftingGrandma viral factory. This isn't just a video uploader; it’s a sentient pipeline that turns raw "Lola Slop" into high-hook, SEO-optimized TikTok gold using the cutting-edge Gemini 3 Flash Preview model.

🧪 The "NerdSauce" Features
🔄 Rolling Key-Pool Relay
Gemini quotas are for the weak. Our engine supports an unlimited, shuffled key-pool. If one Gemini Elf hits a limit or falls asleep, the engine instantly deploys the next key in the stack until the job is finished. No downtime, no limits—just pure, uninterrupted slop production.

⚡ LLM_PIPE_G3_FLASH
Direct integration with Gemini 3 Flash Preview. The app swallows raw MP4 bytes and whispers to the AI. It returns 3 high-hook captions (Taglish or English), 3-3-3 SEO hashtags, and "Director's Notes" including:

VIBE: High-energy Phonk or Bass-boosted Pinoy remixes.

OVERLAY_TEXT: Aggressive, scroll-stopping hooks.

TIMING/STYLE: Frame-accurate overlay suggestions for maximum chaos.

📜 Matrix Telemetry (The Nerd Window)
A real-time, auto-scrolling terminal window that lets you monitor the heartbeat of the machine.

Green Rain: Successful handshake and byte-buffer mapping.

Red Shift: Instant visual alerts when a Gemini key fails or TikTok Elves drop a crate.

Lore-First Logging: We track "PHASE 1: AWAKENING THE GATEKEEPER" and "BARTERING WITH TIKTOK ELVES."

🦅 Quota Sentinel & 201 Salute
TikTok limits API uploads to 5 pending shares per 24 hours. The app tracks your "Salutes" in real-time.

The Sentinel: Detects spam_risk errors and automatically locks the gates to save your AI quota.

Visual Warning: The entire UI shifts into Critical Red mode when the quota is spent.

Audio Feedback: The legendary 201 Salute plays on success, and the Lola Stall plays when a push fails.

🛡️ Greedy Parser Logic
A hardened, non-polite Regex engine that handles the chaotic formatting of AI replies. It strips markdown, scrubs emojis from metadata, and extracts the "Slop" even when the LLM gets creative.

🛠️ Technical Alchemy
Language: Kotlin + Jetpack Compose (Reactive UI)

Intelligence: Gemini 3 Flash Preview (Multimodal)

Key Strategy: Shuffled rolling-relay with auto-failover.

Background Industry: WorkManager + OkHttp3 for robust, byte-perfect uploads.

Security: Vaulted secrets via local.properties (The trolls can't see our keys).

📜 Legal & Lore
"The daily upload cap is reached. The Elves are tired. Go publish your drafts before bartering for more speed." — TikTok API Documentation, interpreted by Lola.
