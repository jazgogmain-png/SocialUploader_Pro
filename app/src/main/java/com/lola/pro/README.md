👵 Lola Pro: The @YesAiDidThis Viral Refinery 🏎
️💨Lola Pro (formerly SocialUploader) is a high-performance, 
private Android video pipeline built to transform raw AI-generated footage 
into SEO-optimized, viral-ready TikTok content. 
Powered by Gemini 1.5 Flash and FFmpeg, 
this tool automates the bridge between automotive car culture 
and high-engagement social media hooks.
🧪 Core Engine Features🎥 The "Bish-Proof" Video Kitchen (v5.3)
We spent significant cycles defeating the "Bish"—the internal parsing inconsistencies 
and metadata ghosts that plague mobile video processing.
Nuclear Orientation Fix: Automatically upscales and crops input 
to a consistent 1080x1920 (9:16) vertical canvas, 
stripping orientation flags that cause "giant text" or "off-screen bleed.
"Viral Safe-Zone Hooking: Hard-codes overlay placement at h/10 (the top 10% of the frame). 
This is the verified "Sweet Spot" for POV hooks that clear the TikTok 'Following/For You' tabs.
Emoji Exorcism: A custom Regex engine that strips non-renderable characters before burning 
to prevent the dreaded "Tofu Box" ($\square$) rendering error in FFmpeg.
Dynamic Word Wrap: Intelligently wraps long captions to a 20-character line limit 
to ensure readability on mobile screens.⚡ LLM_PIPE_G1.5_FLASH (Algo-Mixer)Direct multimodal integration 
with Gemini 1.5 Flash. 
The refinery analyzes raw MP4 bytes to implement a dual-set strategy:Lola Mix (Taglish): Localized humor 
and slang for the PH drifting niche.Int'l Hook (English): High-energy, global automotive hooks for international car culture.
2-2-1 Hashtag Strategy: Implements 2 Trending, 2 Niche, and 1 Branded tag while blacklisting low-value "junk" tags.
🔄 Rolling Key-Pool RelayQuotas are for the weak. The engine supports a shuffled, 
rolling-relay API key pool. If one "Gemini Elf" hits a rate limit, 
the system instantly deploys the next key in the stack to ensure uninterrupted production.
📜 Matrix Telemetry (The Nerd Window)A real-time, auto-scrolling terminal window that monitors the heartbeat 
of the machine:Green Rain: Successful byte-buffer mapping and handshakes.
Red Shift: Instant visual alerts for API stalls or crate drops.
Phase Logging: Track progress from "Awakening the Gatekeeper" to 
"Bartering with TikTok Elves."

🦅 Quota Sentinel & 201 SaluteTikTok limits API uploads to 5 shares per 24 hours.
The Sentinel: Real-time tracking of your "Salutes." 
The entire UI shifts to Critical Red once the 5/5 quota is spent.
The 201 Salute: Dispatches the background worker only when the vault contains valid tokens.
🔒 Security & LegalSecrets Management: This app uses local.properties to manage API secrets. 
Keys are never hard-coded in the source.
Data Privacy: Zero advertisements. Zero data tracking. All processing happens on-device or 
via direct encrypted API calls.
Disclaimer: "The daily upload cap is reached. The Elves are tired. 
Go publish your drafts before bartering for more speed."
