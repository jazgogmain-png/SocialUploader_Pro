# 🏎️ SocialUploader: Privacy Policy

**Project:** Drifting Grandma Social Automation  
**Version:** 1.0 (2026)

### 01. The No-Nonsense Clause
SocialUploader is a private tool built for creators, not data brokers. We hate ads, we hate bloat, and we definitely don't want your data.

### 02. What We Access
* **Storage:** We only touch the folders you tell us to so we can find your `.mp4` files.
* **Network:** We talk to TikTok’s official API to upload your videos. That’s it.

### 03. Token Security
Your TikTok login tokens are stored in **EncryptedSharedPreferences** on your physical device. We never see them, and they never touch our servers (mostly because we don't have any).

### 04. Third Parties
The only third party involved is **TikTok**. Their privacy policy applies once the video leaves this app.

### 05. Contact
If you have questions, open an issue on this GitHub repo. Keep drifting.
